                        Education Is Not A Crime is a global campaign to fight the barring of Iranian Baha’is from the country’s universities. Inspired by Maziar Bahari’s 2014 documentary film To Light a Candle, the campaign quickly won support from Nobel Peace Prize laureates Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Dr Shirin Ebadi, and three others, and several other prominent figures.
